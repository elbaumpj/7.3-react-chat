## 7 3 react chat
* This is a chat app that allows users to set a username and then create messages tagged with that username. The app also displays all the messages for the channel. The messages update every 30 seconds. This assignment's objective was to create a React project that uses a router and Backbone models and collections. There's a link to the live project in the repo description, and you can also clone the repo if you'd like to get it working locally.
